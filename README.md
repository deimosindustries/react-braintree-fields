# React components to integrate Braintree hosted fields

A few small React components to make integrating [Braintree's Hosted Fields](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/hosted-fields/) easier.

# Note

Please refer to the [original forked module](https://github.com/nathanstitt/react-braintree-fields) for additional information, this package temporarily adds a 3DS client on the `onThreeDSecureReady` callback to process cards as per PSD2 regulations which has been enforced from 15th October from Braintree.
